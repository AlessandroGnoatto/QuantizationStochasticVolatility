**Recursive Marginal Quantization of Stochastic Volatility Models**

****************************************

We provide a full implementation of the recursive marginal quantization algorithm of Pag√©s et al. and apply it to a variety of stochastic volatility models in finance.

New models can be added by creating a suitable class in the package it.univr.models together with a parameter function class to be located in it.univr.model.parameters.
